# CS330-Portfolio
Requires OpenGL libraries.

## How do you approach designing software?
- I knew this project would benefit from being highly modular and customizable in every possible aspect. This is how I came to creating a "mini object" system that allowed me to add and remove scene objects by modifying a small amount of data. Given the opportunity to start again I would work even harder to create a flexible system that supported additional object shapes and rendering methods.

## How do you approach developing programs?
- Developing from a requirements-based perspective helped me to focus my efforts on exactly what each project milestone was looking for. Each week was an iteration on the work completed previously, including changing core systems as new requirements were revealed. In particular, to support drawing additional types of objects I changed the renderer from using triangles and vertex index arrays together to raw vertex data arrays.

## How can computer science help you in reaching your goals?
- I am headed towards more courses related to 3D graphics and interactive applications. I believe the skills learned here will be quite valuable in those lessons. Additionally, as a professional game developer, a trip into the visual side of 3D computer applications was a noticeable improvement to my total understanding of how games work.
